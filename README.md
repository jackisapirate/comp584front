# Progress

+ At present, we have been able to use the "api/Account" interface to obtain tokens
+ Three tables "Make", "Model" and "Car" are created in my database.
+ I can use swagger to call and test these interfaces.
+ The Angular (front-end) project can display data information that is stored in the database.
+ We added Authentication Middleware. (2023/04/07)
